### Some of the prompts I used:
1. Can you make a simple framework for a todo list with an input field to add new tasks?
2. For the Sort Tasks button how would you make a dropdown with selections for High to Low Priority, Low to High Priority, and the Due Date?
3. How would you save the items in the list into local storage efficiently?
4. How do you retrieve dates to compare in order to sort from earlier to later?
5. The task modal appears on the page by default when it should not appear until I hit the add task button what is the problem?
6. How do you make the tasks automatically wordwrap on variable size for words that are too long?
7. The delete button is not centered on the line correctly while being right justified, what is the problem?
